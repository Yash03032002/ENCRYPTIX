In this task, you will create a serverless web application that enables users to request unicorn rides from the Wild Rydes fleet. The application will present users with an HTML-based user interface for indicating a pick-up location and a RESTful web service on the backend to submit the request for dispatching a unicorn. The application will also provide facilities for users to register with the service and log in before requesting rides.
